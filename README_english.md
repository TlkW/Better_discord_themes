## üöÄ Introducion:

> Today, I'm going to show you the best discord themes, for you who have doubts, which one to use.

## üìå About the themes:

Here are some themes that can completely change your discord or add a little thing or two.

## **[‚ö†Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/warning/)** Warnings:

Here, there will only be themes that are on the official list of the [betterdiscord] site ([https://betterdiscord.app/](https://betterdiscord.app/)) . So you don't have to worry. Also, better use discord with care as it is not made by the people who work at Discord and if you use it the wrong way you could end up getting **banned**.
